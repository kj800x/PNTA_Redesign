This is a copy of the PNTA.org website source code.
I'm sharing it now that the website has gone offline. I wrote all of the code myself (excepting libraries of course) in my freshman year of high school.
I'm quite proud of how it came out (given my experience at the time), and you can see a snapshot of the website running this code on the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20131026090356/http://www.pnta.org/).
Sadly, the website is offline because PNTA is currently not a robotics team anymore as student interest for the team died down.
